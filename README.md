<h1>Spring</h1>

What is it? What does it do? These are both fairly nebulous questions since the Spring framework does many things and what it is might change depending on what you're using it for. At its core, Spring is a framework built on the principle of <em>inversion of control</em>. Inversion of control is a design principle where we hand over the creation of objects to something else. The Spring framework allows us to put this principle into action. The application of this principle is called <em>dependency injection</em>. Essentially, we mark objects for the framework to create, and then we can inject them from the inversion of control container. 

<h2>This Project(?)</h2>

Is this even a project? Not really. It's just some basic code I wrote to get a feel for using Spring after taking notes on it.
